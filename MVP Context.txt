Context
I am building a company that creates simple, 1 page websites for Airbnb hosts. This means hosts can save on OTA fees. Our target market are Airbnb hosts who don�t have a website yet. We understand it�s hard for hosts to make a direct booking website themselves. It often looks quite bad and is ineffective. So our solution is hosts can come to our website, share their property details and they�ll get a website. To the customer, it�s super simple and they have to do very little and they�re given back a website that they can take bookings on. However, for our MVP we are going to cold call hosts, and once they agree to their site being built by us. We�ll just look at their listing data and create the sites from carrd.co. But for our MVP we�ll need to make a booking system that can be embed into the carrd.co site. We are going to get 10 customers. The MVP will cater for single listing hosts.
Core Features
This is how I want it to work
* The embed will be a booking system
* It will take payment through stripes API
* It will show live availability e.g. the customer of the host will we see the availability of the property on the booking system
* When booked it will sync with the hosts main calendar
* We as a business have a dashboard to see all the hosts and their property
* The host will have a dashboard where they can change the price of certain nights
Reminders
* We don�t have the Airbnb API and we won�t be getting it.
* I want to use Supabase for the backend
* I�d like to host it on digitalocean

Clarifications:
1. Calendar integration will be through a central google calendar that will connect with their airbnb calendar. 
2. Authentication for hosts will be done by email and password
3. What would you recommend for tha carrd.co embed? All I know is the embed has a limit of around 16,000 characters of code
4. Booking information, first name, surname, email, phone number, number of guests, checkin checkout dates, special requests
5. Hosts should be notified by email
6. Calendar management, nothing other than price is needed for now
7. For payment processing, the money the guest pays on the stripe API should go straight to the host
8. Data migration, we will do it manually
9. Commission structure isn�t important. The host will be paying us a yearly fee but we�ll manage that ourselves
10. Cancellation Handling - Host-managed cancellations where hosts can mark bookings as cancelled in their dashboard, and they'll handle refunds manually through their Stripe account. System will update availability calendar automatically.
11. Pricing structure - hosts can change the standard nightly rate, weekend pricing, any individual night, and seasonal, with an option for minimum stay requirements,
12. Guest communication - will be done by email
13. Bookings rules - no buffer needed
14. For my admin panel we just need to see all the hosts that are with us and their site details
15. Hosts will connect their stripe account with stripe connect
16. We will manually link the google calendar
